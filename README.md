- 👋 Hi, I’m @alastair-measures
- 👀 I’m interested in: web development with a geographic slant.  Often this involves Ruby on Rails with either PostgreSQL or SQL Server.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Phoenix, and Elixir with Leaflet.js and PostGIS; based on Docker containers for deployment and development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: perhaps in the construction of training videos.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
